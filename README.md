# GaiNNs
 
 
 GaiNNs is a simple Drag-and-Drop Environment and Character builder to allow users to create their own simulations to train their Neural Network to adapt to. GaiNNs has three main components: the API, the Environment/Character builder, and the IDE. The idea is to be an OpenAI Gym alternative, allowing for a simpler way more intuitive option for users to view and create their own custom environments to be used as training fields. GaiNNs is a tool to help entry level AI programmers get over the initial learning curve that is learning AI programming.
 
 
 
 ## Development Setup
 
 GaiNNs is written entirely in Java using dyn4j and JavaFX.
 
 >### Installation:
 > I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for Java development, but you can use any IDE/Text Editor of your choice. The Installation Guide Provided is for Eclipse and IDEA. Make sure you are running Java 15.0.1. I also recommend using **GitHub Desktop** if you are unfamiliar with git and just want to get working.
